# Electrical Engineering Student @ UIUC


#### WORK EXPERIENCE
**KAUTEX TEXTRON - Manufacturing Engineering Intern**

- Automated parameter logging system of Siemens PLCs using ThingWorx IIoT platform allowing for real-time data visualization and monitoring of connected devices and sensors
- Integrated OPC UA communication protocol between Beckhoff PLC and eWON Flexy router to develop an HMI to display sensor data of welding machines
- Troubleshot Ladder Diagram (LD) of integrated camera sensor on blow-molding machines to recognize scrapped gas tanks leading to 25% decrease in cycle time

*Skills: PLC Programming, ThingWorx, Siemens TIA Portal, Industrial Robotics, Ladder Logic, Sensor Integration, HMI Configuration, Automation, Electrical Wiring*



#### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**PROMOTING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING (PURE) - Robotics/Acoustics Researcher**

- Developed stepper motor control scheme for automated acoustic sensor-source positioning system using ROS2 and Raspberry Pi resulting in precise motion trajectories
- Integrated acoustic sensor to analyze noise produced by system in operation allowing for optimized orientation of motors to minimize audio interference
- Utilized Python to program communication over CAN bus to robotics components enabling motion synchronization
- Simulated testing of “SpiderBot” in virtual environment using Gazebo physics engine 

*Skills: ROS2, Python, Gazebo, CAN, Motor Control, Electrical Wiring, Raspberry Pi, Simulation*
